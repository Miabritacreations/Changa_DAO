 Changa DAO

A full-stack, modern Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) platform built with React (frontend) and Dfinity/ICP Motoko canisters (backend).

 Project Overview

Changa DAO is a complete solution for creating and managing a DAO. It features a user-friendly web interface and a secure, decentralized backend running on the Internet Computer (ICP). The platform enables members to propose, vote, manage profiles, and interact with the DAO treasuryâ€”all in a seamless, blockchain-powered environment.

 Features

- Dashboard: Real-time DAO stats, treasury balance, and recent activity
- User Profiles: Manage member info and avatars
- Proposals & Voting: Create, review, and vote on DAO proposals
- Wallet Integration: Connect and view wallet details
- Decentralized Backend: Powered by Dfinity/ICP Motoko canisters for security and transparency
- Modular API Layer: Easily swap between mock APIs and real canister calls

 Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Material UI, Vite, SCSS
- Backend: Dfinity Internet Computer (ICP), Motoko, Canisters
- API Layer: Modular, pluggable for easy backend integration

Getting Started

 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [DFINITY SDK (dfx)](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html)
- (Optional) [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Changa_DAO
```

 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd src/Changa_DAO_frontend
npm install
```

 3. Start the Backend (ICP Local Replica)

```bash
dfx start --background
dfx deploy
```

 4. Start the Frontend
